Iris Project 🌸
This project focuses on classifying the Iris flower dataset using machine learning techniques. It leverages the classic dataset to predict the species of Iris flowers based on various features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

🌟 Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling and preparing the Iris dataset for training.
Model Training: Training a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to classify the species of Iris flowers.
Model Deployment: Using deploy.py to deploy the model for inference on new data.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive exploration and training in training.ipynb.

🔧 Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/143durga/iris-project.git
cd iris-project
Install Required Libraries: If you’re using a virtual environment, activate it and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Ensure you have a requirements.txt file with necessary libraries, or install them manually)

Run the Jupyter Notebook: Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and train the model:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook training.ipynb
Deploy the Model: After training the model, you can deploy it using:

bash
Copy code
python deploy.py
🌟 Future Enhancements
Model Evaluation: Implement additional metrics for evaluating the model’s performance, like confusion matrix or ROC curve.
Web Interface: Develop a simple web interface to input new flower data and get predictions.
Advanced Models: Try other advanced models like Neural Networks or Gradient Boosting for better accuracy.
